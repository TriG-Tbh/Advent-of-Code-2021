# Advent of Code 2021

Repository for my [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions, with write-ups for each day

---

## Write-ups

Post-completion write-ups for each problem can be found in [`Write-Ups.md`](https://github.com/TriG-Tbh/Advent-of-Code-2021/blob/main/Write-Ups.md). These write-ups will be exactly what goes through my head after completing each day.

A more formal post-calendar write-up can be found in [`Post-Completion.md`](https://github.com/TriG-Tbh/Advent-of-Code-2021/blob/main/Post-Completion.md).

## Thanks

I've said it many times at this point. What harm could one more time do?

**Huge thanks to**

- the members over at [Pydis](https://discord.gg/python) for being super helpful with the most confusing problems
- Eric Wastl for making the entire calendar (though I have a love-hate relationship with it, I have to admit it surely must take a lot of work to make something I keep coming back to)
- the Python Core Development team for making such a beautiful language to work with
