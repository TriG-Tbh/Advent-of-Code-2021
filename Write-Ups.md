# Write-Ups

Day 1:

- honestly wasn't all that difficult
- adapting script for day 2 was a bit of effort but honestly took like 2 minutes

Day 2:

- literally wasn't difficult at all
- just the addition of a third variable was all it took to complete part 2

Day 3:

- ok this one was actually difficult
- i had to rewrite the entire program to satisfy part 2
- one of the things i like is utilizing the very little things about python that i almost never use on a daily basis, solely for the purpose of optimizing these

Day 4:

- literally had to write **part 1** twice just for it to work
- first attempt was really complex
- second attempt was held together with spit and gum
- once part 1 worked, i had to take what i wrote apart so that i could reverse the whole process
- took literal hours to complete

Day 5:

- was going back and forth on using numpy
- constantly got memoryerrors because there was just too much data
- had to rewrite multiple times
- ultimately reused part 1 solution for part 2 but slightly modified it

Day 6:

- way too easy
- incredibly easier than days 4 and 5
- i think i was just graced with the idea of using a dictionary as early as i did

Day 7:

- lmao what was this
- (i've been informed that weekend problems are made intentionally harder than weekday problems)
- still this one was way too easy
- a lot easier than day 6's
- but **i've finally completed a whole week!**

Day 8:

- i like to call this one `"list comprehension ad nauseum"`
- day 1 was really easy
- day 2 was much more difficult but still fun
- works by first attempting to solve for each individual segment, then building each digit from the segments it uses

Day 9:

- i was _going_ to complete it within an hour after it was released
- but i couldn't figure out how to get the top 3 items in a list
- (also the recursive branch function i had beforehand wasn't working)
- so i implemented my own
